Running files
----------------
- Running "Preprocessing.py" will generate "pools-java.txt" and "findroute.pl".
- To run Java run the .jar file using "java -jar FindRoute.jar pools-java.txt",
this will produce the file "path-java.txt" which is the appropriate path. You can delete
"path-java.txt" however you will need to re-run the "Preprocessing.py" script. You can also
delete the "path-java.txt" file and to get it back just re-run the .jar file.
- To run the prolog file use "swipl -s findroute.pl". Everything should work from there. However note
that the algorithm is rather inefficient. So it will take 2-3 minutes to finish. You can delete
"path-prolog.txt", and to get it back simply rerun the saveRoute query and specify the destination file.
You can delete "findroute.pl", and just need to rerun the "Preprocessing.py" script.
